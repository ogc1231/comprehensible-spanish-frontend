## Code Validation
### CSS
I have used the recommended [CSS Jigsaw Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator) to validate all of my CSS files.

The css was copied from name.module.css and pasted directly into the validator and shows no errors. However when the live site link was used the validator showed parse errors caused by Boostrap and Fontawesome.

### ESLint Validation
I have used the recommended [JShint Validator](https://eslint.org/) to validate all of my JS files.

All JavaScript code was validated using the integrated ESLint JavaScript validator following this [Guide](https://gist.github.com/ianmeigh/8e603b91a38d7829d959402bfcf29d3d) to validate all of my JS files.

## Automated Testing
I have conducted a series of automated tests on my application.

I fully acknowledge and understand that, in a real-world scenario, an extensive set of additional tests would be more comprehensive.

## Unfixed Bugs
- On devices smaller than 375px, the page starts to have `overflow-x` scrolling.

    - Attempted fix: I tried to add additional media queries to handle this, but things started becoming too small to read.

- For PP3, when using a helper `clear()` function, any text above the height of the terminal does not clear, and remains when you scroll up.

    - Attempted fix: I tried to adjust the terminal size, but it only resizes the actual terminal, not the allowable area for text.

- When validating HTML with a semantic `section` element, the validator warns about lacking a header `h2-h6`. This is acceptable.

    - Attempted fix: this is a known warning and acceptable, and my section doesn't require a header since it's dynamically added via JS.

If you legitimately cannot find any unfixed bugs or warnings, then use the following sentence:

There are no remaining bugs that I am aware of.
